    "   - Convert categorical features to numbers using Label Encoding\n",

    "   - Apply to: `gender`, `contract_type`, `internet_service`\n",

    "4. **Train-test split**\n",
    "   - Split data into 80% training, 20% testing\n",

    "\n",
    "2. What do these important features tell us about why customers leave?\n",
    "   - Customers are more likely to leave if they have less favorable contract types (e.g., month-to-month contracts), higher monthly charges, or less reliable internet service. These features indicate that pricing and service quality play a significant role in customer retention.\n",
    "   - Improving contract terms or offering better value for money can help reduce churn, as customers may be dissatisfied with high costs or poor service.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Business Recommendation: Based on these results, what is ONE action the telecom company should take to reduce churn?\n",
    "   - The company should consider offering discounts or incentives for customers on month-to-month contracts to encourage them to switch to longer-term plans, or review pricing and service quality to address the main reasons for churn."
